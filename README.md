## **Description**

_A personal reddit-style journal app. Organize your thoughts by creating thought boards and post individual thoughts/ideas to it! This versatile app can be used to collect your favorite memes, store app ideas, or record journal entries related to specific categories of your life. Post links, images, links to other websites, or blocks of text._ 

This is a teamweek project done to showcase the skills we learned through the Epicodus C# curriculum, demonstrating our knowledge of ASP.NET Core MVC routing, migrations with Entity Framerwork and SQL, and Authorization through Identity.

## **Setup/Installation**

*Installing .NET Core* 

1. Download the .NET Core SDK [Software Development Kit](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Open the .Net Core SDK file and install.
3. Confirm the installation was successful by runnning the `$ dotnet --version` command in your terminal (You should see something like this in the response: `2.2.105`).
4. Install the dotnet script REPL tool by running the `$ dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script` command in your terminal.
5. Restart your terminal to complete the installation.

*Installing MySQL | MacOS:*

1. Download the MySQL Community Server DMG File from [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914)
2. You can exit the mysql program by entering `exit`.
3. Download the MySQL Workbench DMG File from [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391). (Use the No thanks, just start my download link.)
4. Install MySQL Workbench to Applications folder.
5. Open MySQL Workbench and select the `Local instance 3306 server`. You will need to enter the password you set. (We used `epicodus`.) If it connects, you're all set.

*Installing MySQL | Windows 10:*

1. Download the MySQL Web Installer from [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919) (Use the No thanks, just start my download link.).
2. Choose `Custom` setup type.
3. When prompted to `Select Products and Features`, make sure you select both `MySQL Server` (Under MySQL Servers), and `MySQL Workbench` (Under applications).
4. When you reach `Configuration`:
  * Set `High Availability` to `Standalone`. 
  * Defaults are OK under `Type and Networking`. 
  * Set `Authentication Method` to `Use Legacy Authenticationn Method`.
  * Lastly, set your password and complete the installation process.
5. You can exit the mysql program by entering `exit`
6. Add the MySQL environment variable to the System PATH. We must include MySQL in the System Environment Path Variable. This is its own multi-step process. Instructions here are for Windows 10:
  * Open the Control Panel and visit System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables...
  * Then select PATH..., click Edit..., then Add.
  * Add the exact location of your MySQL installation, and click OK. (This location is likely `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin`, but may differ depending on your specific installation.)
7. Open MySQL Workbench and select the `Local instance 3306` server (it may have a different name). You will need to enter the password you set (We used `epicodus`). If it connects, you're all set.
